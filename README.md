This small example uses PSQL, as this is what I have used in the past and was ready to go on my machine.

To test the queries first clone down the repo: `https://github.com/back-jond1992/gbl_sql.git`

To run individual files type `psql -f database/<filename>` in the command line.

To run all files `bash run-all.sh`

The answers to the queries can be found `03_queries.txt` and the queries themselves are in `03_queries.sql`.
